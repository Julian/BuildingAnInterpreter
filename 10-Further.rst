Going Further
=============

At this point you likely have a number of further ideas for extension.

Implement them!

For some further inspiration:

    * Loops! Function calls! Methods! More operators. Extend your parser,
      compiler and interpreter to support these, turning Snap into an actual
      programming language.
      
    * Add some more types!

    * We haven't even mentioned how to add a JIT to your interpreter. The
      RPython docs cover the basics. Your task will be to inform the RPython
      toolchain about a number of the fundamentals within your interpreter,
      such as where your main loop starts, and what the lifecycles of some of
      your variables and objects are within your interpreter.
