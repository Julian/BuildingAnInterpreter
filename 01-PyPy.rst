or:

Windows binaries are available at the above link.

PyPy should be available in your Linux distro's package manager.

Alternatively, tarballs are available at:

which should work across distributions.


Running PyPy

As with CPython, the REPL is accessible via ``pypy`` at a terminal.

Feel free to play around a bit, whereby you'll (hopefully!) notice nothing
amiss.
